Taking 2017's \"Demonstration Disc\" as a point of departure, \"Evening Flower\" employs the same tactics and techniques: meticulous recording and editing of sound samples, a focus on so-called “extended technique“ in the recordings themselves, development of custom software to aid in the composition process, in general, a factory-like or production-line mentality/attitude toward sound as a kind of fungible, material object.\n\nIt's therefore surprising that the result could be so rich, organic, and emotional. The album's roots and influence in spiritual jazz and Satie-esque mysticism are almost disconcertingly at odds with the calculating approach that got it there.\n\nWhereas Demonstration Disc was a buffet of sounds –the Sound Library itself consisting of over 1500 sounds, all of which Grier tried to cram into a 40 minute run-time– on \"Evening Flower\" a single instrument is the focus: piano, and the spiritual and cultural legacy of some of that instrument's modern adventurers who pushed the instrument and the form: Charles Ives, Art Tatum, McCoy Tyner, Abdullah Ibrahim, "},{"attributes":{"background":"initial"},"insert":"Irène Schweizer, and Therre Thaemlitz, to "},{"insert":"name a few.\n\nOf course, \"Evening Flower\" is released alongside an expanded and re-vamped Sound Library, which is advertised and distributed more and more like a mature software product. Nonetheless, Grier is not interested in making a technocratic album, but whether the piano can be pushed further, how little or how much this necessarily involves machine intervention, mediation via sampling, and live improvisation; and how little or how much \"instrumental teleology\" itself remains relevant.\n\nJason Grier is a programmer and music producer from ?¿?.
